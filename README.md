# beyond_gOOD_spreadsheet
This project was completed during the second half of my Object Oriented Design class. My original programming partner was named Joseph Guadagno. We had our differences and got new partners after I created the model portion of the spreadsheet. My new partners name was Ishani Kapoor. 

This spreadsheet application utilizes the Model-View-Controller design pattern. We also utilized the Swing library for our graphics.
